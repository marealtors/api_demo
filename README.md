# api_demo
Repo for the RAMCO API Python demo. Contains a Jupyter Notebook with Python code examples for the class examples. You can open this file in several different software packages to use it to code and edit Python very easily - it's a great format for learning and trying out new code. 

This repo also contains a file with Jason Normandin's PHP methods for reference, we've reproduced them (mostly) in Python to show the differences and similaraties. 

You don't need to follow along live, but if you want to, you'll need to put all these files in the same directory, set your config.py file up with a valid RAMCO API key for your system, and you'll need a couple Contact GUIDs for members whose records you're farmiliar with to get started properly.
